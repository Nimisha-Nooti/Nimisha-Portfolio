Creating the my portfolio website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
This is a responsive single-page portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. It showcases my professional profile with sections covering About Me, Skills, Projects with GitHub links, Certifications, Work Experience, Resume Download, and Contact Information. The site has a clean, modern, and mobile-responsive design that provides recruiters and clients with a quick and engaging summary of my background and work.
