        <p>Some of my latest projects and case studies.</p>
        <p><h3>Credit Score Classification Model</h3>
                <b>Overview:</b> This project presents a machine learning solution for classifying individuals based on their credit scores using the CatBoost algorithm. The primary objective is to determine whether a person falls into categories such as "Good", "Standard", or "Poor" creditworthiness based on a set of financial and behavioral attributes. The model is built with scalability and practical deployment in mind, making it suitable for use in financial institutions and fintech applications. A web API is also included to make predictions easily accessible.</p>

        <p><h3>Predicting Covid-19 High Risk Counties Across NY State</h3>
                <b>Overview:</b> This project analyzes the intersection of healthcare utilization, COVID-19 burden, and social determinants of health (SDOH) across counties in New York State. Using data from SPARCS (hospital discharges), the U.S. Census (ACS), CDC SVI index, and NY State COVID-19 APIs, we created an integrated dataset to identify high-risk counties for COVID-19 spread and health system strain.</p>
                <b>Key components include:</b><br>
                1. Data cleaning and standardization across multiple public datasets<br>
                2. Feature engineering (e.g., hospitalization per 100k, positivity rate, SVI scoring)<br>
                3. Predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost) to classify high-risk counties<br>
                4. Visualizations (heatmaps, scatterplots, Tableau dashboard) for insight communication<br>

                This analysis supports data-driven public health decisions, with potential for use in targeted interventions, policy planning, and health equity research.<br>

        <p><h3>EDA - Diabetes Prediction Analysis</h3>
                <b>Overview:</b> The primary objective of this project is to analyze and identify the key factors influencing the likelihood of diabetes in individuals by leveraging health-related data. The insights derived from this analysis aim to support healthcare providers and insurance companies in better understanding risk profiles, enabling proactive medical intervention and tailored treatment plans. Additionally, the project seeks to assist insurance providers in risk assessment and premium structuring based on individual health indicators.

                Through exploratory data analysis and visualizations, by applying statistical analysis, data cleaning, and visualization techniques, the goal is to answer specific business and clinical questions that can guide healthcare professionals in predictive diagnosis and personalized treatment plans, and help insurance companies in risk assessment and policy development.
                
                Ultimately, the project aims to deliver data-driven recommendations and clear visual narratives that support strategic decision-making and promote proactive health management.</p>

        <p><h3>Hotel Booking-Data Analysis</h3>
                <b>Role:</b> Analyzing the Hotel booking data.

                Due to strong growth of hospitality industry and hotel sector specifically in recent years there is an increased need from management and industry professionals in order to understand how guest select hotels to stay in and what are decision making factors that prevail. Furthermore, goal of this project is to analyse in depth and compare data that is discussing selection process of hotel booking as well as what decision making process guest follow.This is contributed to the fact that most of previous studies focused on choice attributes rather than decision-making process itself.
                
                what we are doing in this kernel is something like:
                
                Basic cleaning : seperating the required data from the data set to use it for analysing. Understanding the factors effecting the booking : Factors like seasons, festivals and holidays effect the data. Univariable study : We'll just focus on the dependent variable and try to know a little bit more about it. Test assumptions : We'll check if our data meets the assumptions required by most multivariate techniques.
                
                There are 119390 rows and 32 columns in the given data set. From the variables we will evaluate the dependency of hotel booking as follows:
                
                Hotel wise analysis, Booking cancellation analysis, Bookings based on Meals, Countries, Room Type., Distribution channel wise analysis, Lead time analysis, Revenue analysis, Bookings over time analysis.</p>

        <p><h3>Frontend Development Project: Age Calculator</h3>
                <b>Role:</b> This project is a beginners and intermediate frontend developers level project as it solidifies understanding of:

                HTML Structure: Building forms and content display.
                CSS Styling: Applying visual design and layout principles.
                JavaScript Fundamentals:
                DOM manipulation (interacting with HTML elements).
                Event handling (responding to user actions like button clicks).
                Date object manipulation and calculations.
                Conditional logic and functions.
                Input validation.
                In essence, the Age Calculator project is a practical demonstration of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create an interactive and functional web application.</p></p>
